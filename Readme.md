## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:

Since I have dabbled around with Android Development, building this application wasn't particularly
challenging. Most of the challenges revolved around recollecting concepts like Intents
and the use of interfaces to set up interactions across activities.

The most notable change since I last worked on app development is the replacement of Android Support
Libraries with Android X. I'm sure there are many more that I will encounter throughout this journey.
